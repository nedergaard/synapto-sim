# synapto-sim
## Unity and C# based simulator of evolving creatures with a small neural network brain

Disclaimer: this readme.md was written before a single line of code has been written. Which means that it currently is more of a vision statement than anything else.

### Introduction
synapto-sim is a Unity project written in C# that simulates creatures in a 3D world with simulated physics. The project focuses on the evolution through reproduction of simulated neural network brains of these creatures. The genetic code of the parents are mixed randomly and a mutation is added. It provides a platform for experimenting with the principles of evolution, and emergent behavior.

The simulation is built using the Unity engine and C# for the neural network, creature senses, and capabilities. Unity's powerful features enable the creation of a visually appealing 3D environment. The modular architecture of synapto-sim allows for easy extension and customization, enabling users to experiment with different aspects of the simulation.
